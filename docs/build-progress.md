# Build Progress — MVP v1.0

Tracks progress against the Build Order in [`menurate-spec.md`](menurate-spec.md) Section 11.
Updated as steps complete — see git history for full detail on each one.

## Status: 11 of 11 steps complete — MVP v1.0

All 11 Build Order steps are done, verified (typecheck/lint clean, each step driven end-to-end with
Playwright against the real dev server and live Supabase project), and committed. The app runs
locally against a real, non-trivial dataset: **59 real Ottawa-area restaurants and ~5,791 real menu
items**, sourced from official restaurant sites only — no aggregators, nothing fabricated. Every
core loop from the spec works end-to-end: discover a restaurant → search by dish or name → rate a
specific menu item → report bad content → admin moderates → users contribute edits/tags/photos
(trust-gated, or live for a verified owner) → owners claim and manage their own listing.

What "MVP v1.0" means here: the full data model, auth, discovery, search, rating, moderation,
contribution, scraping, claim, and photo-upload skeleton from the spec exists and is provably
correct. It does **not** mean deployed, styled, or launch-ready — see "Known gaps" below, and
[`post-mvp.md`](post-mvp.md) for what's tracked next (UI/theme work, deployment, and anything else
that comes after this point). This file is now a historical record of how the MVP was built, not a
live to-do list — new work gets tracked in `post-mvp.md` instead.

### ✅ Step 1 — Schema + Supabase setup
Full Section 7 data model as Supabase migrations (profiles, brands, restaurants, menu_items, tags,
menu_item_tags, restaurant_tags, ratings, reports, edit_logs), RLS enabled on every table. Live
Supabase project: `menurate-production`.

### ✅ Step 2 — Auth
Email/password sign-up/in/out via Supabase Auth. Session refresh via `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16's
renamed middleware). Email confirmation is **off** for now (dev convenience, no inbox round-trip
needed to test) — flip `supabase/config.toml`'s `[auth.email] enable_confirmations` back on before
real users arrive.

### ✅ Step 3 — Restaurant + MenuItem read pages
`/restaurants` list, `/restaurants/[id]` detail with menu grouped by category. Chain restaurants
show "This location" vs "All [Brand] locations" ratings side by side; independents show one.
Seeded via `scripts/seed.mjs`.

### ✅ Step 4 — Tag system + unified search
Search bar in the header (every page) searches restaurant names and dish/tag names simultaneously.
Dish matching (name OR tag, sorted by rating) lives in a `search_menu_items()` Postgres function.

### ✅ Step 5 — Rating flow
`/menu-items/[itemId]` detail page: submit a 1–5 rating + optional comment, aggregate updates live.
One rating per (user, item) — re-rating updates rather than duplicating.

### ✅ Step 6 — Rating integrity
Per-account daily rate limit (20 new ratings/24h) and burst/anomaly auto-flagging (5+ distinct
users rating one restaurant high/low within an hour) both enforced by database triggers. Signup
throttling per IP is Supabase Auth's own built-in rate limit — no custom code needed.

### ✅ Step 7 — Report flow + admin page
Report button on restaurants, menu items, and ratings/comments. `/admin/reports`: dismiss/remove
actions, plus a duplicate-restaurant merge tool. Admin account: `isaiahkwapisz@gmail.com`.

### ✅ Step 8 — Contribution flow
Trust-gated menu item edits — established accounts (7+ days old, unpenalized trust score) go live
immediately; low-trust accounts queue in `pending_edits` for admin approval. Tag application (to
existing tags) is live for any signed-in user; creating a brand-new tag always queues for admin
approval. Auto-revert: 3+ open reports on a menu item reverts its most recent edit automatically.

### ✅ Step 9 — Scraper
Standalone pipeline in `scraper/` (`npm run scrape`), architecturally separate from the Next.js
app. Restaurant discovery is a manually-curated URL list (`scraper/sources.mjs`, currently empty —
Google Places API setup was deliberately deferred). Geocoding via free OSM Nominatim. Parses
schema.org Menu/MenuItem structured data; sites without it are skipped rather than scraped with
fragile generic HTML heuristics. Fuzzy dedup (name + address, `pg_trgm`) prevents duplicate
restaurant rows at ingestion. Pages are rendered with a real headless browser (`scraper/browser.mjs`,
Playwright) before parsing, not a plain fetch, since real sites are often JavaScript-rendered.

**Real-world research:** checked 10 real sites for usable structured data — 4 major fast-food
chains (Tim Hortons, Wendy's, Mary Brown's rendered fully but emit zero Restaurant/Menu schema;
McDonald's blocks automated browser requests outright) and 6 real independent Ottawa restaurants.
Conclusion: menu-item-level structured data is genuinely rare in the wild, rarer than
restaurant-level data (schema.org scraping remains available in `scraper/` for the rare site that
does emit it, but isn't the primary ingestion path today).

**First real data batch (ingested):** pivoted to AI-assisted manual research (reading each
restaurant's own official site directly, never aggregators, never fabricating unlisted items or
prices) to seed the database with real Ottawa-area restaurants. Ingested via
`scripts/ingest-batch1.mjs` (reuses `scraper/geocode.mjs` + `scraper/ingest.mjs`'s dedup-safe
`ingestRestaurant()`), sourced from `scripts/data/*.mjs`:

- **59 restaurants**, **5,791 menu items**, all real, all from official sources.
- 14 independents (Cocotte, Riviera, Supply & Demand, Rabbit Hole, JOEY Lansdowne, 4 Ottawa pizza
  spots, Delicious Steakhouse, Hidden Taste, Rangoli, Cucina da Vito, Saigon Bistro).
- 8 chains across 45 Ottawa-area locations (Lone Star Texas Grill, Boston Pizza, Montana's BBQ &
  Bar, Chuck's Roadhouse, Moxie's, State & Main, St. Louis Bar and Grill, The Royal Oak).
- A few sites had no readable menu (LaHa Tacos, Golden Fries — JS ordering widgets; Soul Stone —
  PDF-of-images menu; The Bad Alibi — blocks automated access) and were left out rather than
  guessed at.
- The Royal Oak's own site 403s automated fetches entirely; its data came from Wayback Machine
  snapshots instead (still the restaurant's own real, official content, just retrieved via
  archive.org rather than the live site).
- Verified live on `/restaurants` and a couple of detail pages post-ingestion (category grouping,
  per-location vs. all-locations rating comparison for chains).
- Not yet collected: menu item `description` text (schema supports it — nullable column already
  exists — just wasn't part of this research pass) and a few large beverage/wine sublists were
  trimmed for brevity on a couple of chains.

### ✅ Step 10 — Restaurant claim flow
Any signed-in user can submit a claim on an unclaimed restaurant's page (with an optional message
for verification context); claims queue in `restaurant_claims` for admin approval on
`/admin/reports`, same review-queue shape as pending edits/tags. Approving a claim sets
`restaurants.owner_user_id` and `source = 'claimed'`, and auto-rejects any other pending claims on
that restaurant. Once claimed: the owner edits their own restaurant's menu items live regardless of
trust score (RLS-enforced via `is_restaurant_owner()`, not just app-level), and can toggle
`require_owner_approval` to force *all* crowd edits (even from established/high-trust accounts)
into the pending queue for admin review. Footer's placeholder claim link now points people to the
real per-restaurant claim button; a `mailto:` remains only for removal requests.

### ✅ Step 11 — Photo upload + proactive image moderation
Signed-in users attach photos to a menu item or restaurant (with a required "I own this or have
permission to share it" checkbox). Photos land in Supabase Storage (private `photos` bucket, all
access brokered server-side via signed URLs — no direct client access) and a `photos` table row
with `status = 'pending'`. **No automated moderation API is configured** — `IMAGE_MODERATION_API_KEY`
in `.env.local` is an empty placeholder, same situation step 9 hit with geocoding — so
`lib/moderation/scan.ts` is a documented stub and every upload holds for manual admin review on
`/admin/reports` instead of an automated pass/fail. This is a stricter proactive posture than an
API scan alone (100% human review before anything goes public), not a workaround; swap the stub for
a real Rekognition/SafeSearch call whenever that key is populated. Photos are reportable too (added
`'photo'` to `report_target_type`), and the admin Reports queue shows the actual image thumbnail for
both pending-photo review and photo reports, since judging an image requires seeing it.

## Live infrastructure

- **Database/Auth/Storage**: Supabase project `menurate-production`
- **Source control**: [github.com/IsaiahKwpz/MenuRate.Com](https://github.com/IsaiahKwpz/MenuRate.Com)
- **Hosting**: none yet — the app only runs via `npm run dev` on localhost. Deploying (Railway
  per spec Section 8) hasn't come up as a Build Order step; worth doing whenever you want this
  reachable outside your own machine.

## Known gaps to revisit before real users

- Email confirmation is off — re-enable in `supabase/config.toml` before launch.
- `scraper/sources.mjs` has no real restaurant URLs yet — the automated schema.org scraping path
  is proven against test fixtures, but real-world research found menu-item-level structured data
  genuinely rare (see step 9 notes above). Real data now comes from the manual-research batch
  instead (`scripts/ingest-batch1.mjs`), not the automated scraper.
- No automated image-moderation API is configured (`IMAGE_MODERATION_API_KEY` is an empty
  placeholder) — every photo upload currently holds for manual admin review instead of an
  automated pass/fail. Wire up AWS Rekognition or Google Vision SafeSearch in
  `lib/moderation/scan.ts` when that's ready to reduce the manual review queue.
- No deployment/hosting exists yet.
